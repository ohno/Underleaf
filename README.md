# Underleaf

This is just a local LaTeX editor using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). This was built in a few hours. There are no special functions. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) if you need more functions. If you really want to thank me, you can [give me a star](https://github.com/ohno/Underleaf/).
