# Underleaf

https://ohno.github.io/underleaf/

This is just a local LaTeX editor using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). This was built in a few hours. There are no special functions. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) if you need more functions. If you really want to thank me, you can [give me a star](https://github.com/ohno/underleaf/).

## Developer's Guide

[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) will be installed with the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

Please open `index.html` in your browser.
